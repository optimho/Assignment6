Assigment 6 is a file handling example in Dart.
It opens a file and reads the contents searches for words, creates a file writes to that file and ultimately deletes the file.
The file searches through a long file. I have uesed a text form of the bible as the long text.
I found copies of the bible here: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8300/pg8300.txt
or just search gutenberg site for some free texts that can be used.
